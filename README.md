Forneymon is a java program that has the goal to simulate a Pokemon Game. Instead of pokemon, it's forneymon. Each forneymon has their own type, level, and health. 

The program uses many methods such as, adding forneymon to a collection, removing forneymon, getting the MVP of the collection, trading forneymon, and rearranging forneymon in the collection.

The purpose of this program is to practice downcasting, using forneymon object variables, collections, and using multiple helper methods.
